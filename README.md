# Thank you for installing my mod, Busted Buffoons!

## But before you install this pack of powerful jokers...
Install [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman) and [Cryptlib](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptlib) first, they're needed to pull off external value manipulation and higher operator scoring.

## There's also Crossmod content for...
[900n1Gamblepack](https://github.com/900n1/900n1Gamblepack),
[Starspace](https://github.com/MetaNite64/Starspace),
[UNIK's Mod](https://github.com/70UNIK/UNIKs-mod)
